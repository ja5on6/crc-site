					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I recently came across The Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal and thought it's a pretty cool side project. To have the certifications and knowledge is one thing, but to be able to hands on and do is another level. </p>
					<p>To go through my own "baptism by fire", I got started and created this completely serverless site. </p>
					<p>It has a static frontend, a dynamic backend for counting the number of visitors (bottom of this page), and a DevOps pipeline to automate deployment (in partial development now, coming soon!).</p>

				<h1>How I Built This</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<details>
					<summary><h2>0. Planning</h2><span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 5 hours</p>
					<p>There is a saying in Chinese, ä¸‡äº‹å¼€å¤´éš¾, which roughly translates to everything is hard in the beginning, and it is the same for this project as well. With the minimalistic outline of the challenge, I was scratching my head on where to begin. </p>
					<p>I took some time to understand the overall architecture needed, and trodded on looking for a good html css template. </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary><h2>1. HTML and CSS Front-end</h2><span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 20 hours</p>
					<p>No beating around the bush but of cause I took a ready-made template, but in the midst of adding in the content here, I figured instead of making it a duplicate of my linkedin page, why not outline my journey towards full stack web development, as I develop this site? So over a couple of days in the evenings after work, I worked on getting the setup right. </p>
					<p>This involved tweaking the html and css code base, within Route 53 setting up a domain and hosted zone, S3 static site hosting.</p>
					<p>With a publicly accessible http site, now it's time to make it HTTPS. </p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary><h2>2. CloudFront</h2><span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 5 hours</p>
					<p>Security is job zero, and one way to make my site more secure is by CloudFront, which also speeds up the delivery of the site to the end user as well. </p>
					<p>The new CloudFront portal is surprisingly easy to use. I also activated AWS Certificate Manager as part of getting the TLS/SSL. </p>
					<p>As I make changes to my site, some routine tasks such as logging in, file uploading etc became more of a chore, and I realised the need for automation. </p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary><h2>3. Front-end automation</h2><span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 10 hours</p>
					<p>With minimal working knowledge of Git and GitHub, this step was no easy feat. </p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary><h2>4. Site visitor counter</h2><span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 30 hours</p>
					<p>The only easy day was yesterday. </p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary><h2>5. SAM and more</h2><span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 40 hours</p>
					<p>To be updated! </p>
					<!--A test to review the Python code, create local repo on SAM such that when push git, the SAM application get packaged and deployed to AWS. -->
					<!-- for the python test, it is usually called an end-to-end test or smoke test, can consider cypress. Can add cypress test as a github action after deployment finishes. -->
					<!-- to blog about it, include an architecture image using lucitchart or draw.io -->
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary><h2>9. Reflections</h2><span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 2 hours</p>
					<p>To be updated! </p>
					<!--To learn fast and google well. -->
					<!--Self-motivated -->
					<!-- to be good at problem solving. -->
					<!-- to be patient -->
