# crc-site
This is the code repository for Jason's Cloud Resume Challenge site
It was previously fully hosted through AWS at https://jason.geekkout.com/ since Sept 2021
As I am deprecating the domain (geekkout.com), in Oct 2022, I have moved the front end to 2 places:
1. Netlify, at https://geek-out.netlify.app/
2. AWS Amplify, at https://jason.darr.win/
The backend (API Gateway, DynamoDB, Lambda) still stays on AWS.
